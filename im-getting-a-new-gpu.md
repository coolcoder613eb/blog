# I'm getting a new GPU

I'm getting a GPU upgrade!

Currently, I have a GTX 970 with 4GB VRAM, which, while it can run all my games, has issues with AI, some more than others. This is due to the low VRAM, which means some AI cannot run. Therefore, I have been looking on Gumtree for a better GPU.

Yesterday, I found a few GPUs on Gumtree, but the best deal of the lot within my budget was a GTX 1070 Ti with 8GB of VRAM for $100 AUD. This morning, the seller sent it off via post, and according to the parcel tracker, it should arrive on Monday or Tuesday.

This GPU was being sold, apparently, because the seller got it from a friend, but it didn't fit in his case. I mentioned to the seller that I was planning on selling my old GPU, and I thought I could get a decent price for it because it still had over 9 months warranty left.

The seller asked how much I was planning on selling it for and its dimensions. Finding the measurements, it seems my GTX 970 was short enough to fit in his case, so he said that he was interested in buying it.
