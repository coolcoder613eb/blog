# Getting stuff off tapes

My father had some audio cassetes he wanted to
digitalise, and he asked me to research it.
I asked around on IRC and Discord, and I was told
to use a tape recorder connected to the audio input
of a PC. I only have two PCs with audio input, my
desktop, with Haiku, Linux, Windows XP, and FreeDOS,
and my headless laptop, with Windows 98,
Windows 2000, and BeOS.
BeOS being "The Media OS", I decided to go with
that.

Then I had to procure a tape recorder, not having
one at home. I eventually got one from my
grandmother, but I didn't have any tapes to test
it with!

Well, Sunday night, I got a tape, I connected the
headphone jack of the tape recorder to the
microphone port of the laptop, opened up
SoundRecorder, pressed the record button, and
pressed play.

An hour and a half later, I stopped the recording
and tried to play it back. No good, the recording
was incomprehensible.
I then tried lowering the
volume on the tape recorder, and it started
sounding much clearer.
Monday morning, I made a new recording, and it
worked.

Mission accomplished.
