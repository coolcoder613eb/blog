# Playing MIDI with a floppy drive

I recently decided to try out [FloppyMIDI](https://web.archive.org/web/20071214053358/http://www.bebits.com/app/4510), a BeOS driver that plays MIDI music using a floppy drive.

After connecting a spare floppy drive to my BeOS PC (heeding the warnings of *"This will almost certainly destroy your floppy drive!"*), I installed the driver. So far, I've played quite a few MIDI files without any issues and recorded all of them.

You can find my recordings here: [FLOPPYMIDI.zip](https://ctrl-c.club/~coolcoder613/FLOPPYMIDI.zip)
